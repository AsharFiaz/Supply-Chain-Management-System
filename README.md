# Supply chain management system
it was my DSA semester project. I made it in order to get mastery at different Data Structures and algorithms. I used concepts of Different Algortithms to solve the problem of supply.\
Using Dijkstra Algorithm to find shortest path to supply to all the stores
Using Prims algorithm to find shortest path from a dedicated and specified store.
Also using Hashng to keep track of stores with capacity level below a certainn threshold
